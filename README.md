# AntiVandal

AntiVandal is a web-based counter-vandalism tool. It is similar to [Huggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:HG) in design and usage, though it is a more lightweight version and has a simpler interface.

## Usage

After the script is installed, beside your preferences button, there should now be a link which says "AntiVandal". Clicking this should activate the script.

The interface itself is fairly simple: pressing the spacebar will go to the next edit, and pressing "q" will mark the edit as vandalism, revert it, and warn the user who made the edit automatically. A full list of features and controls is available at [Wikipedia:AntiVandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AntiVandal).
