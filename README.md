# AntiVandal

AntiVandal is a web-based counter-vandalism tool. It is similar to [Huggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:HG) in interface and usage, though it is a more lightweight version and does not require the [rollback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:ROLLBACK) user right to revert.

## Usage

After the script is installed, beside your preferences button, there should now be a link which says "AntiVandal". Clicking this should activate the script.

The interface itself is fairly simple -- pressing the spacebar will go to the next edit, and pressing "q" will mark the edit as vandalism, revert it, and warn the user who made the edit automatically. There are also options to select from a variety of [warning templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WARN), and can report users at [AIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AIV).
